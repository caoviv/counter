# Counter
I created a simple counter and wrote conditions that change the color based on positive or negative numbers displayed.

I built this project to practice more working with the DOM

Key concepts covered:

- document.querySelectorAll()
- forEach()
- addEventListener()
- currentTarget property
- classList
- textContent
